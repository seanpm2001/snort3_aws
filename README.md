## How to configure helm chart

### AWS EKS deployment with gateway load balancer (GWLB)
Please see aws/gwlb and aws/eks in this repo for creating GWLB and EKS using cloudformation templates.

snort3:
  - daq: gwlb
  - interface: eth1
  - mode: -Q # use -Q for inline mode and -v for passive mode
  - numThread: 4

Here interface is where snort3 will be listening on for Geneve traffic (UDP port 6081). Please make sure
you have security group rule to allow incoming traffic from UDP port 6081.

### On-prem deployment
snort3:
  - daq: afpacket
  - interface: eth0:eth1
  - mode: -Q # use -Q for inline mode and -v for passive mode
  - numThread: 2

For on-prem deployment, you should use afpacket in general. If you want to deploy it with inline mode, you
need an inline pair of interfaces. Please refer to snort3 manual (https://github.com/snort3/snort3/releases/download/3.1.16.0/snort_user.pdf) for more details.
